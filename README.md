# qt-looper

Qt-Looper is a virtual track looper for recording and playing back simple MIDI tracks in loops. The framework was built in C++ using a bunch of specific MIDI libraries, and the interface was generated using Qt. I made this for my final project in CS 312: Audio Programming.

## TODO(?):
- [ ] Right now the repo is just a dump of all of the source code and built files. I built and ran this on a school computer and haven't tried getting it to work on my personal laptop. Perhaps a small project for the future
